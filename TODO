TODO

Create
	Anonymous beers (beer 1, beer 2) with a reveal at the end or revealed from the start (Kaldi, Einstok)
        so maybe add a "anonymous" attribute

	Add option if the admin should control next round or let it be automatic

	Create gets its own page
		Add beer becomes much more comprehensive
			Name
			Description
			Color (? to color the graph bar with the beer's color ?)
			Each beer has category dropdown (Ale, Pale ale, Stout, Porter etc.)
			Optional picture of beer
			Try to find an API to help with autofill

		Be able to invite people by name or email
			if the user is not already registered with facebook or email - send email with invitation

		When adding a beer, a side nav shows all beers added so far, enabling you to rearrange them with up/down/delete buttons

		Advanced mode, for much more options for rating, based on a template online
Room

    TV:
	   TV sees the rating the current beer is getting, crowd favorite/least favorite
       figure out how to resize charts
	   show the description of the current beer - make it auto-update after all participants have voted

	Admin:
        can control the flow of the game, sends "next round" to all clients ( if setting is enabled when creating )
			until the next round is sent, users can only vote on one beer at a time
		Can rearrange beer order, with up/down/delete buttons - delete button needs modal confirmation

		BeerList is just names and beer numbers, if clicked, generate a dropdown with more info (for mobile friendlyness)

Profile

	Create a profile page, where you can see your best rated beers
	Get suggestions based on the beers you've rated the highest
	Set a nickname
	Be able to add friends


Extra fun stuff
(options for create)
	When a user rates a beer 10-10-10, a toastr notification shows up on the TV with something like:
		"Holy shiet! Benni just had the best beer of his life!"
	Users get to pick if their ratings can be public or not, default is false
		If they are public, they can be shown on TV part
	When creating, hosts can choose if nicknames are allowed to be shown as the user's name
		To prevent "penisLord" names for official events...

	When a beer has been rated by all participants, show a few random users ratings, the highest and lowest perhaps
		If they choose to, their comment about the beer will be shown as well as their picture
