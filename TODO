Create
	Anonymous beers (beer 1, beer 2) with a reveal at the end or revealed from the start (Kaldi, Einstok)
        so maybe add a "anonymous" attribute

	Also add a "description" attribute which will be shown on the TV

Room

	If the user is the owner of the room, be able to select if he wants to be the TV, admin or regular user

    Regular user:
        should not be able to press submit if the event is not started (by setting "started" attribute on event to true) or if he has already submitted a grade for the current beer
        When he submits, add grade to history chart and publish for TV

    TV:
	   TV sees the rating the current beer is getting, crowd favorite/least favorite and the rating history for all beers
       figure out how to resize charts
	   show the description of the current beer

	Admin:
        can control the flow of the game, sends "next round" to all clients
		until the next round is sent, users can only vote on one beer at a time
