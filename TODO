Create
	Anonymous beers (beer 1, beer 2) with a reveal at the end or revealed from the start (Kaldi, Einstok) 
        so maybe add a "anonymous" attribute

Room
    Subscribe to the correct event (_id) and fill the chart of relevant information

	If the user is the owner of the room, be able to select if he wants to be the TV, admin or regular user
    
    Regular user: 
        should not be able to press submit if the event is not started (by setting "started" attribute on event to true) or if he has already submitted a grade for the current beer
        When he submits, add grade to history chart and publish for TV

    TV:
	   TV sees the rating the current beer is getting, crowd favorite/least favorite and the rating history for all beers
       subscribe to the ratings db

	Admin: 
        sees all users in the room, can kick users and force the next beer before all have voted
